          description: `Atma is a technology entrepreneur and adventure traveler. During a trek in the Ladakh and Zanskar region of Northern India, he connected with his guides who were local residents. One of the nights in the trek was spent at a guide’s home. During dinner with the guide’s family, he heard about the challenges and lack of business prospects for an adventure guide. He wanted to build a site that would benefit these guides and build a lasting experience for travelers. GreatGuides’s mission is to directly connect guides with adventure travelers seeking authentic experiences.`
